"""D5 outbound-duplicate drill: WE are the duplicating sender (D1's twin).

Arms the same DuplicatingTransport that `peer --duplicate-outbound` uses in
a real game — every one of OUR outbound turn pushes goes out twice — and
proves in-process that a dedup-capable receiver (our own stub) absorbs all
of them: game completes, mutual audit Verified OK, digests match. Against a
foreign peer over a tunnel the identical wrapper demonstrates the sender
half of the duplicate-delivery drill live; point [network] opponent_url at
their MCP URL and run `uv run p2p-thief peer --duplicate-outbound`.
Every duplicated send lands in the JSONL evidence as an observed event.
