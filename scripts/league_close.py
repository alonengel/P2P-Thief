"""Series-runner helpers: email preflight + auto-close (split out of
league_series.py for the 150-code-line cap).

Preflight: a posture that OWES a report ([email] mode = send) must prove
deliverability BEFORE window 1 — recipient non-empty and a live refresh
against the OAuth TOKEN endpoint only, reusing infra/email_sender's token
logic (no Gmail scope is touched here and no mail moves). A posture that
cannot deliver refuses the whole run with zero games played.

Auto-close: when this runner's last window settles and every sub-game log
of the series is visible across BOTH results dirs (ours + the sibling
repo's — read-only FILE access, never a cross-repo import), the existing
`series-result` aggregation runs with --email. An incomplete series names
exactly who is missing and closes nothing: the sibling runner owning the
final window performs the close, and the settlement guard inside the
aggregation stays the backstop either way.
