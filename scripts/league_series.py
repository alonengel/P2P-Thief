"""League-day series runner - drives THIS repo's (thief) sub-game windows.

The book's role alternation gives the police repo the ODD sub-games of a
counted series and the thief repo the EVEN ones; on league day each repo
starts its own runner at the agreed time (T-protocol) and the two runners
interleave into one continuous 6-sub-game series. Every window launches
the real committed CLI in a subprocess (`uv run p2p-thief peer
--sub-game N [--seed base+N]`) and waits for it - strictly sequential.
A lockfile carrying our pid under results/local/ makes a second concurrent
runner instance refuse to start: the orchestration-layer half of the
double-instance guard (the wire layer's game_uid/sub_game_number checks
are the other half). HONESTY: a failed window is logged to stdout and the
runner moves on - nothing is retried blindly and nothing is fabricated;
the series-result settlement guard (rule 35) downstream refuses the whole
series if any window never settled.

Bookends (scripts/league_close.py): a send posture proves email
deliverability BEFORE window 1 (else the run refuses with zero games
played), and after this runner's last window settles the series
auto-closes IF every sub-game log is visible across both repos' results
dirs - otherwise the missing windows are named and nothing aggregates.

Usage: uv run python scripts/league_series.py --sub-games "2,4,6" [--seed 900]
