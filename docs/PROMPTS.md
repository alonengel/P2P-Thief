and lessons. Newest entries last.

## 2026-07-13 — Session 1: requirements extraction & master plan

**Context.** Project kickoff. Inputs: the 160-page rulebook PDF, the 39-page
submission-guidelines PDF, the official demo repo, and our prior course work.

**Prompt pattern — parallel exhaustive extraction.** We fanned out reading
agents over page ranges of the rulebook with the instruction: *"Your report
must be EXHAUSTIVE — this project is graded against this book and nothing may
be missed. Distinguish MANDATORY (חובה/אסור) vs RECOMMENDED (מומלץ) vs
EXAMPLE-ONLY; note every square-bracketed parameter; report formulas, protocol
flows, state machines precisely, with page numbers."*
**Outcome.** Complete requirements dossier: 55 mandatory rules, the Appendix ו
parameter table with fixed/minimum/negotiable statuses, config architecture,
submission checklists.

**Prompt pattern — adversarial verification.** After drafting the plan, we ran
independent verifier agents per page range: *"Go SENTENCE BY SENTENCE. Report
ONLY (a) requirements missing from the plan; (b) requirements stated
incorrectly; (c) nuances that could cause disqualification."*
**Outcome / lesson.** The adversarial pass caught real errors a single reading
missed — e.g. rule 27 mistranslated ("library protocols" instead of the actual
ban on numeric-coordinate dialogue), the game-count declaration wrongly labeled
trust-based, the sealed commit record being richer than the 4 core fields, and
the missing intra-turn commit-order agreement. Lesson: **extract, then attack
the extraction with fresh agents; never trust one pass over a graded spec.**

**Prompt pattern — design under constraints.** A planner agent received the
dossier plus hard constraints (two repos, 150-line files, 85% coverage, uv-only,
many commits) and returned the module map, phase plan, and risk register that
seeded PLAN.md/TODO.md.

**Key clarifications asked of the humans (never assumed):** repo code-sharing
strategy, tunneling tool (ex6 evidence: free ngrok unreliable → Cloudflare),
LLM provider scope (all four modes + OpenRouter), team identity (anrbj666),
strategy ambition (strongest per role + optional RL).

## 2026-07-13 — Session 2: Phase 1 (base game logic), TDD in paired slices

**Context.** First code phase; everything under `domain/` is parity-locked with
the twin repo.

**Prompt pattern — spec-quoting tests.** Each test module opens by quoting the
rulebook rule it encodes (e.g. "rules 13-14", "rule 47") and test names state
the rule (`test_barrier_beyond_quota_is_rejected`,
`test_stay_does_not_rescue_a_surrounded_cell`). This keeps the suite readable
as a compliance checklist, not just a regression net.

**Prompt pattern — golden vectors as the twin contract.** Instead of trusting
two codebases to "look the same", we generated `physics_vectors.json` from the
implementation once (kernel, 0.9→0.81→0.729 decay series, corner clipping,
two-turn evolution) and copied it byte-identically to the sibling; both suites
assert exact equality. Lesson: **behavioral identity is a test artifact, not a
code-review promise.**

**Workflow lesson.** The pre-commit parity hook (correctly) blocked a commit
made before the sibling port — the paired-commit order is: port to sibling's
working tree FIRST, commit here, then commit sibling. Recorded in the
workspace rules.

**Audit.** A spec-auditor agent re-read the dossier sections (board, pheromones,
state machine) against every domain file before the phase was closed.

---

## 2026-07-13 — Session 2 (cont.): Phase 2 MCP infra + first cross-repo game

**Pattern — probe the installed API before writing against it.** One tiny
script confirmed fastmcp 3.4.4's run()/Client surface before mcp_server.py
was written; zero API-mismatch rework.

**Pattern — integration test as coverage strategy.** Instead of omitting the
transports from coverage (demo's approach), a slow-marker test drives a REAL
FastMCP server on an ephemeral port; both transport modules stay in the 85%
gate.

**Debugging lesson — shutdown races are protocol design.** First cross-repo
run: police exited immediately after receiving the thief's audit, killing its
server mid-HTTP-session; the thief's final send died with httpx.ReadError.
Fixes: classify read/write/closed errors as retryable, make the audit send
best-effort, add a shutdown grace period. Lesson: **the last message of a P2P
session needs the same engineering care as the first.**

---

## 2026-07-13 — Sessions 3-5: phases 3-8 (compressed log)

Patterns that repeated and paid off: (1) spec-quoting tests named after rules;
(2) port-to-sibling-BEFORE-commit (the parity hook blocks the wrong order);
(3) probe-the-API-first before writing infra; (4) field failures became
design notes the same hour (proxy session churn -> persistent sessions;
expired OAuth tokens -> runbook warning; DPI-skewed screenshots -> aware
mode). (5) The 150-line cap forced two genuinely better extractions
(Perception, SealedExchange). (6) A "SUBMISSION READY" claim was challenged
by the user - a fresh audit against the dossier found two unwired MUSTs
(watchdog rule 7, auto-email rule 32) and missing PRD files: **checklists
verify what you told them to; the dossier is the contract.**

---

## 2026-07-18 — Session 6: reference byte-form alignment (interop)

Prompt (paraphrased): *"Review a friend team's interop kit repo + its GitHub
issues; adopt only what doesn't evade the rules — and show me everything
before doing anything. Rule for adopting: only if BOTH the official demo AND
the kit have it. Tag a rollback checkpoint first."*

Process: deep-compared the kit's vectors against our crypto, then verified
its central claim directly against the official reference in
`../docs/DemoExamples` (never trust a third party's claim about a source you
hold yourself). Confirmed the reference uses `ensure_ascii=False`, a
pipe-appended-nonce commit preimage, a terms-derived game_uid, and a SECOND
(spaced) serialization for the settlement consensus signature. Our forms were
legal (the book is self-contradictory and permits a documented choice) but
non-interoperable — rule 19 makes byte-agreement existential. Adopted the
reference forms (ADR-0004), kept the book-faithful scent model (book beats
example), and imported the kit's vectors (MIT, attributed) as a
foreign-conformance suite so the alignment is *proven*, not assumed.

Lessons: (1) "correct" and "able to play" diverge when the ecosystem
standardizes on the example, not the spec; (2) a rollback tag + pre-release
before a breaking alignment makes the decision cheap to reverse; (3) verify
counterparty claims against primary sources — the kit was right, but now we
KNOW rather than believe.

## 2026-07-18 — Session 7: logging, verifier, and the deep-RL arms race

Prompts (paraphrased): *"How is my Q-learning support? Use agents to see how
to improve"* → *"We should have loggings, no? See how the demo and book do
it"* → *"Go deep learning or something even harder, I want us to be the
best"* → *"Does it take barriers into account? Training for both roles,
separately?"* → *"Improve it even more, adjust the weights and such."*

Process: two review agents audited RL and logging against the guidelines;
research agent pinned the demo/book logging conventions (runtime traces are
gitignored diagnostics, game artifacts are the committed record — book ch. 8
Log Manager split). Implemented: wired logging_config.json, timestamped
single-instance gatekeeper, physics-recomputing verifier (verify-log now
proves "untampered AND physics-legal"), config-true replay geometry. Then
the RL campaign: pure-Python MLP Q-networks (no new deps), Double-DQN with
replay + target nets, barrier actions for the cop, a two-round arms race via
weight-DATA crossover between the twins (never code imports), a 6-config
hyperparameter sweep, and two gated promotion attempts — both correctly
REJECTED by gates coded before the results existed.

Lessons: (1) put promotion gates in code before running the experiment —
twice an exciting intermediate number (a trivially-passing gate at smoke, a
0.82 at short budget) would have shipped a worse model on vibes; (2)
negative results recorded as artifacts (from-scratch collapse, robustness
collapse, knife-edge information dependence, the structural 0.74 ceiling
confirmed by three independent runs) carry more academic weight than the
positive ones; (3) specialist vs generalist is a real trade — the 1.00
evader is blind-fragile (0.00 under belief noise), which became the
evidence-backed case for keeping the robust hand-coded brain as league
default; (4) the 150-line cap and pre-commit hooks caught real drift
repeatedly — friction that pays.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 8: deception engineering (self-mirror lie policy)

Prompt (paraphrased): *"Upgrade the deception engineering: replace the
truth/lie coin in the runtime with a policy that lies exactly when it pays.
Build a SelfMirror (a second belief filter fed only by our own emissions,
estimating what the rival can infer about US), a DeceptionClock (lie budget
+ cooldown), and a DeceptionPolicy (lie only when exposed AND the rival is
believed close AND the clock allows). Decoys point away from the true
heading. All tunables in a private [deception] config table; mirror the seam
into the sibling with a conservative cop posture; prove the receiving-side
profiler still counters it; measure policy-vs-coin."*

Process: TDD both repos (16 unit tests + 1 runtime-integration test each,
red first). The mirror reuses the rival's exact BeliefMap pipeline pointed
at our own role — no duplicated math; the runtime feeds it at the precise
point the rival's Perception observes us (post-boundary for the thief who
closes turns, pre-boundary for the cop who opens them). Numeric prototyping
BEFORE pinning assertions caught two traps: corner diffusion shifts the
argmax off the true cell, and the cop's pre-boundary scent lag caps its
exposure (~0.45), which made a 0.5 threshold silently inert — probed the
live exposure/distance distributions and set the cop default to 0.4.

Lessons: (1) the reputation economy measures beautifully — same outcomes at
3.0 vs 17.8 lies/game (thief) and 2.0 vs 18.0 (cop): truth is cheap when it
buys credibility; (2) a policy whose trigger never fires is a silent bug —
measure trigger rates, not just end results; (3) sealed intent flags make
deception audit-honest: the verdict trail the audit reveals IS the policy's
decision log, asserted verbatim in the integration test.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 9: chaos-drill suite (live-path robustness evidence)

Prompt (paraphrased): *"Build a chaos-drill harness proving the robustness of
the live path, with committed append-only JSONL evidence. Drills over REAL
HTTP MCP games (our runtime vs an in-process scripted stub opponent): D1
duplicate delivery (sealing dedup absorbs an at-least-once resend), D2 silent
opponent (deadline -> clean technical loss + watchdog persist), D3 transport
flap that heals inside the retry budget, D4 endpoint dead past the whole
budget (classified, never a hang). Plus a LIVE public-tunnel drill: kill
cloudflared mid-game and heal on the named tunnel's stable hostnames. Every
evidence line must be a really-observed event — never fabricated; mirror the
whole suite in the twin repo."*

Process: reused the integration-test machinery (two real FastMCP servers on
ephemeral ports) plus a tiny TCP proxy that severs live connections and
rebinds the same port; all knobs in a private `[chaos]` config table; the
drills re-run as slow marker-gated tests with evidence redirected to tmp.
Two wrong assumptions died on contact with reality: (1) the FSM does NOT
always end in TECHNICAL_LOSS — the book's table has no edge from COMMITTING
or WAITING_FOR_OPPONENT, so the classification lives in the engine outcome +
typed error; (2) a severed endpoint does not fail fast — the persistent MCP
session holds the in-flight call (SDK-internal reconnect) and the outer
retry loop is the backstop, so D3 asserts the game FROZE and completed
rather than counting retries.

Lessons: (1) the first live tunnel run found a real gap — a downed Cloudflare
tunnel answers HTTP 530, which `_is_connection_flavored` did not retry
(only 502-504): one marker line fixed it and the recorded kill/heal game is
the end-to-end proof; (2) chaos drills earn their keep by breaking the
author's model of the system, not the system itself; (3) pass criteria must
encode observed mechanisms, or the drill tests the assumption, not the code.
author's model of the system, not the system itself; (3) pass criteria must
encode observed mechanisms, or the drill tests the assumption, not the code.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 10: competitive audit & the interop decision brief

**Context.** Ahead of the cross-team wire-shape negotiation, we audited a
rival league team's PUBLIC repos (their code being public is the league's
mutual-audit culture; ours is read the same way) and turned the findings
into build directives for our own repos.

**Prompt pattern — three-axis adversarial audit.** Parallel agents, one per
rival repo: *"Audit on three axes: (1) rule compliance/evasion — shared live
state, UI truth leaks, LLM-in-the-move-path, coordinate protocols, Gmail
scope, secrets, fixed-parameter drift, and anything sneaky (privileged info
reaching a brain, timeout farming, test rigging); (2) quality vs the course
guidelines every team is graded on; (3) honest head-to-head vs OUR repo —
where are they better? Flag DISQUALIFYING/SERIOUS/MINOR with file:line
evidence; if you can't confirm something, say so explicitly."*
**Outcome.** No violation found (their compliance engineering is excellent) —
but the head-to-head axis produced our work list: their committed live-drill
evidence and 1000-line prompt log exceeded ours; our submission artifacts,
book-default physics, and RL narrative exceeded theirs. One real cross-team
protocol hazard surfaced (at-least-once delivery vs strict step continuity)
that our sealing dedup already handles — it became a joint-ADR agenda item.

**Lessons.** (1) Audit the rival to find YOUR gaps: every "they're ahead
here" line converted directly into a same-day build (chaos drills, deception
policy, this log's depth). (2) Insist on the honesty clause in audit prompts
— "if you can't confirm, say so" is what kept shallow-clone history limits
from becoming false assurances. (3) Severity-tagged, evidence-cited findings
are immediately actionable; untagged prose audits are not.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 11: deception by movement (leakage-aware evasion)

Prompt (paraphrased): *"Build deception by movement for the thief: a
leakage-aware term in move scoring — for each candidate legal move, preview
the SelfMirror update it would cause (own next emission + diffusion on a
COPY of the mirror's BeliefMap, never mutating live state) and prefer
landings that keep the mirror flat (high entropy, low exposure at our true
next cell). Blend weight + on/off flag under a private [deception.movement]
table; compose with the lie policy (fewer lies when the trail is already
ambiguous); measure ≥60 seeded games/arm vs the strongest in-repo blind cop;
default ON only if it pays, otherwise record the negative result. Own-side
information only — guard-test both that fact and move legality."*

Process: probed the physics BEFORE pinning tests, and the probe killed the
briefed intuition — walking where our old scent is strong does NOT leak
least: staying/backtracking onto the own-scent hotspot is the MOST exposing
(the mirror's mass already sits there), while stepping off a still-hot
trail leaves it behind as a decoy. First implementation (stealth as a
subordinate tie-break under an uncapped flee term) measured as a flat
null: BFS distance is almost always distinct, so stealth never voted —
survival, tracking error, and lie spend all unmoved at any blend weight.
The design that worked caps the flee term at a config `safe_distance`:
knife-range distance still rules absolutely; among safe landings stealth
chooses. Sweep (safe_distance × blend_weight) picked 3/8.0.

Lessons: (1) measured 60/arm vs the belief-driven TrapCop (captures the
base brain 60/60): survival 0.00 → 1.00, exposure 0.41 → 0.34 — and the
honesty check vs the pursuit-only cop shows the cost, 1.00 → 0.95, with
the composition payoff of 3.0 → 1.72 lies/game; default ON, trade-off
recorded in docs/evidence/movement-deception.md. (2) A term that never
changes a decision is a silent null — sweep the weight and confirm the
metric MOVES before believing any verdict. (3) A "no signal at any weight"
result is an architecture smell, not a tuning problem: authority (what may
outrank what), not magnitude, was the lever.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 12: config-range fuzzer + crash-resume (E5/E6)

Prompt (paraphrased): *"Two infrastructure features, mirrored in both repos.
(E5) A legal-config-range fuzzer: sample the space a counterparty may LEGALLY
propose — Appendix-VI minimums raised (board 7-11, barriers 14-24,
max_moves=survival 35-60, valid distinct starts), FIXED values never fuzzed
(assert it) — and run a full in-process self-play game per sample over the
roundtrip HTTP-MCP machinery, checking invariants (legal shared outcome,
matching digests, clean audits, turn/barrier bounds). 40+ samples committed
to results/experiments/ + docs/evidence/. (E6) Crash-resume: per-half-turn
atomic snapshots (records incl. nonces, action log, agreement) under
results/local/, ON by default; a resume path that replays through
protocol.apply_action and re-arms the SealedExchange; a resume_offer control
handshake answered by re-sending the last sealed pair (dedup absorbs
duplicates); a kill-and-resume drill with real JSONL evidence."*

Process: TDD against the loopback-pair pattern from the runtime tests; the
runtime sat at 149/150 code lines, so ALL resume logic went to a new
peer/resume.py and the runtime gained only four hook lines (docstrings paid
the rent). The drill's first run failed honestly: the reused chaos helper
always calls play() fresh, so the resumed peer re-negotiated into a void and
ate a deadline — the drill needed its own classified runner that continues
from the re-armed turn. Deliberate scope line: snapshots are half-turn
atomic; a crash between commit-send and reveal-send loses that half-turn's
nonce and MUST NOT be re-committed differently, so recovery is defined from
the last completed half-turn (documented in docs/evidence/crash-resume.md).

Lessons: (1) a resume feature is really a replay feature — reusing the one
true apply_action path made engine fidelity a one-line digest assert;
(2) the at-least-once dedup we built for lost HTTP acks is EXACTLY the
mechanism that makes resume handshakes safe — new capability, zero new wire
rules; (3) fuzzing the negotiable ranges (40/40 green) is the cheap proof
that "nothing hardcoded" is true in the physics, not just in the config
loader. Fuzzer found no real bug; nothing in domain/ needed touching.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 13: survival certificate (endgame escape proof, keep-gated)

Prompt (paraphrased): *"Thief half of the endgame module: a survival
CERTIFICATE — if a strategy exists that survives all remaining turns against
worst-case cop play (moves AND barriers) over the cop-belief support, lock
onto it. Belief-correct: worst case over EVERY cop cell carrying
non-negligible mass; never read the rival's true position (guard test).
Wire WITHOUT editing thief_brain.py (owned by a concurrent task). Compute
hard-capped. Measure survival with the certificate on/off vs the arena cops;
keep ONLY if stronger, else default OFF and record the negative result."*

Process: `strategy/endgame.py` holds the memoized worst-case search plus
`CertifiedThiefBrain`, a wrapper the `[strategy] thief_class` seam points at
— it composes the shipped ThiefBrain by inheritance, so the owned file was
never touched; tunables are read from the private TOML inside the module
for the same reason. Key semantic guard: a certificate covering fewer than
the remaining turns proves NOTHING, so the horizon gate requires
`turns_left <= max_horizon_turns` (unlike the cop solver, where a shallow
forced win is valid any time). Soundness is engine-adjudicated: from a
certified state every legal cop reply line must stay certified and end in
SURVIVAL — the physics referees, not the search.

Lessons: (1) honest negative result — 0 certificates in 180 measured games
(90/arm, identical survival 0.333): the full-information hunters end games
by turn ~14 while the certificate window is the last 5 turns, and the
scent-floor cop-belief support never sharpens to ≤3 cells; default shipped
OFF (docs/evidence/thief-certificate.md), seam left wired since the
disabled wrapper is move-for-move the shipped brain. (2) The composition
seam beat the temptation to edit the owned brain: subclass + config pointer
delivered the integration with zero contention. (3) Symmetric features need
asymmetric gates — copying the cop solver's "min(horizon, remaining)" here
would have certified unsound survival claims.
every unit test and obvious to the rollout.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 14: public pair-verifier & the stale artifact it caught

**Prompt (paraphrased).** *"Extend the replay verifier into a league tool:
verify ANY two teams' logs of the same game — each side alone, then mutual
consistency (uid, end digest, record-for-record commit equality). Offline
over files only; never touches a live game."*

**Outcome.** `report/pair_verify.py` + `scripts/verify_pair.py`, TDD (6
tests: consistent pair, tampered record, uid/digest mismatch, missing step
in the rival's view, forged commit swap, tolerated pre-audit verdict
absence). First run on our own committed artifacts immediately caught a
real defect: the g02 self-play logs were sealed under the PRE-migration
commit byte-form and read TAMPERED to any grader. Regenerated via a fresh
cross-repo match and added a guard test that replay-verifies EVERY
committed log artifact, so stale evidence can never linger silently again.

**Lesson.** Point new verification tooling at your own artifacts first —
the tool paid for itself before it ever saw a rival's log.

## 2026-07-22 — Session 13: reference-v3 hidden-information wire (phase 1)

**Prompt (paraphrased).** *"Build phase 1 of a reference-v3 (hidden-
information) wire client as an ADDITIONAL mode behind a config/negotiation
seam: own-state engine (rival position structurally unknown), demo-shaped
TurnMessage codec (smell_grid transmitted, commit per step, reveals
deferred to the audit), capture-claim flow with a structurally-enforced
truth duty, a hidden-mode runtime reusing the hardened receiver machinery,
audit-time physics reconstruction, and guard tests for every rule-sensitive
surface (rules 8-9, 18, 21-22, 25, 27). Bookletter stays the untouched
default; wire_shape declared via the registry lock-doc hash under the
both-declare rule. Mirror across both repos; never touch domain/."*

**Outcome.** New `wire/` package (9 modules, mirrored twin): `own_state`
(engine duck-type whose `positions` dict simply has no rival key — belief-
only play enforced by shape; the thief answers every capture claim from
this state and nothing else), `codec` (closed demo key set: step/sender/
hint/smell_grid/commit/timestamp + the four claim fields; unknown keys
rejected so a position can never ride along), `claims` (truth duty as pure
functions of own state — no strategy parameter exists), `hidden_exchange`
(SealedExchange subclass: commit-only live wire, reveals verified at audit
against the live-received commits), `lock` (registry doc pinned to
sha 229ae648…, both-declare refusal table), `hidden_runtime`/`hidden_turns`
(the loop; the thief closes each round and updates its own field BEFORE its
snapshot ships), `audit` (replay on Board physics with an explicit
truth-duty check). 76 new tests per repo (byte-exact book-model scent
fixtures incl. the ordering probe; dedup/reorder/flood on the hidden wire;
full in-process games: random, survival, landing-claim capture,
barrier-on-thief — all ending in clean verified audits; hidden logs verify
through the existing replay machinery unchanged). One shared edit:
`peer/sealing.py` duplicate-branch lookup made payload-tolerant
(`r.get("payload", {})`) so the subclass can reuse the hardened receiver —
bookletter semantics byte-identical, full suite green.

**Lesson.** The engine-replay audit was wrong for this wire: a thief that
steps onto the cop's cell is unobservable live (capture is claim-mediated),
so an instant-capture reconstruction would flag honest games as TAMPERED.
The audit now proves exactly what the wire can prove — captures created by
the cop's own action, concessions forced by the truth duty — and the
documented deviation is itself the strongest argument for keeping the
reconstruction in wire/, not domain/.
