# TODO — P2P-Thief

Legend: `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done.
Every stage ends with: spec-auditor pass + code-review pass + TODO update commit.
Definition of done per stage = the binary milestone from PRD.md §7.

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap
- [x] Repo init: LICENSE (MIT + attribution), .gitignore (secrets first), README stub
- [x] uv scaffold: pyproject (ruff, pytest, coverage 85 branch), .python-version 3.13
- [x] shared/version.py (CODE_VERSION 1.00, config-version gate) + tests
- [x] Thin CLI with --version + tests
- [x] config/: game.json (Appendix VI values), game.toml (identity), rate_limits.json, logging_config.json, config/games/
- [x] Required dirs: data/ results/ assets/ notebooks/
- [x] CI (gitleaks, line cap, ruff, coverage, smoke) + pre-commit + gate scripts
- [x] Docs skeletons: PRD, PLAN, TODO, PROMPTS, ADRs 0001-0002
- [x] Claude tooling: .claude/agents (code-reviewer, spec-auditor, guidelines-auditor, test-designer, physics-parity), hooks, CLAUDE.md
- [x] Pushed to origin continuously; CI green (verified via gh)

## Phase 1 — Base logic (PRD_01)
- [x] domain/board: grid, barriers, legality (orthogonal+STAY, no diagonals)
- [x] domain/rules: captures (landing/barrier-on-thief/blocked), survival ≥35, quota-excess rejection
- [x] domain/scoring: 20/5/5/10/tie 2/technical 0
- [x] domain/scent: 5×5 radial emission (0.9), decay 0.10 once per FULL turn
- [x] domain/state_machine: legal transitions only, TECHNICAL_LOSS terminal
- [x] domain/engine: cop-first rounds, barrier-forgoes-move, mid-round captures
- [x] Golden physics vectors (tests/vectors/physics_vectors.json — byte-identical with twin)
- [x] Self-play driver test: full local game crash-free (20 seeds, both endings)
- [x] Spec-auditor pass on Phase 1 deliverables

## Phase 2 — MCP infra (PRD_02)
- [x] infra/mcp_server: 4 tools → thread-safe queues; port-busy fail-fast
- [x] infra/mcp_client: retry-until-opponent-up transport (+shutdown-race hardening)
- [x] shared/config: JSON-overrides-TOML, version gate wired to startup
- [x] domain/negotiation: byte-identity + config_sha256 + commit-order pinning + Appendix-VI limit enforcement
- [x] peer/deadline: expiry on every awaited request
- [x] domain/protocol + peer/runtime + sdk + cli peer subcommand
- [x] Milestone: geometric game vs P2P-Thief process over localhost — MILESTONE OK (results/dev-history/results/cross_match_prd02_2026-07-13.json)
- [x] Spec-audit of Phase 2 done — fixes applied: move_set + technical_loss + league constants added to FIXED_TERMS; in-flight MCP calls bounded by response_timeout_sec (rule 6); COMMIT_ORDER/SHUTDOWN_GRACE noted for config promotion
- [x] (done in Phase 6) GamePhaseMachine wired into the runtime; failures route to TECHNICAL_LOSS

## Phase 3 — Blind strategy (PRD_03)
- [x] strategy/brain_base (BrainBase seam, [strategy] toml override, loud bad-spec failure)
- [x] strategy/thief_brain: BFS distance maximization + corner-averse openness tie-break (+CopForArena)
- [x] Self-play arena; MILESTONE: evasion brain survives >=20/25 random cops

## Phase 4 — Language + scent (PRD_04)
- [x] domain/belief: diffuse x scent x hint posterior; (1-rho) lie detection (book p.30 example encoded)
- [x] strategy/hints: template provider (0 tokens), truth/lie claims + intent flag, word cap on every path
- [x] infra/llm_provider registry (ollama/claude_api/claude_cli/openrouter) + TalkChain (every_n_steps, unconditional template fallback, TokenMeter)
- [x] Hints+belief wired into the runtime (hint rides the turn message; diffuse->scent->hint belief update on receive)
- [x] Belief-driven brains + blind MILESTONE passed; live blind cross-match: thief survived 35 turns (vs capture-in-13 under full info) - uncertainty works as designed
- [x] shared/gatekeeper + rate_limiter (token bucket, daily quota threshold, DOS circuit breaker)

## Phase 5 — Tunneling (PRD_05)
- [x] Persistent single-session McpTransport (dedicated loop thread, session rebuild on failure)
- [x] MILESTONE: full blind game over https://mcp.alon.website (named tunnel) - 35 turns, digests identical (results/dev-history/results/public_tunnel_prd05_2026-07-13.json)
- [x] peer/watchdog (rule 7) + persistent-session reconnect hardening
- [x] Milestone: full game over public URL (PRD-05 evidence)

## Phase 6 — Crypto (PRD_06)
- [x] domain/crypto: canonical JSON, pinned 7-field sealed record, SHA-256 commit/verify, secrets nonce, binary audit
- [x] peer/sealing: SealedExchange - 4-phase commit/ack/reveal/audit per half-turn
- [x] Step-0 data in the declaration artifact (hardware spec via sysinfo, git commit hash, counted-games; sealed exchange next to negotiation TBD for league)
- [x] peer/audit: nonces ride the end audit message; every rival record recomputed -> Verified OK/TAMPERED in the report
- [x] Tamper-injection tests -> TAMPERED (payload rewrite, wrong nonce, count mismatch)
- [x] FSM wired into the runtime (COMPUTING->COMMITTING->AWAITING_REVEAL->VERIFYING; failures -> terminal TECHNICAL_LOSS)
- [x] MILESTONE: cross-repo match fully sealed - 35 steps, audit Verified OK both sides

## Phase 7 — Reporting + GUI (PRD_07)
- [x] report/artifacts: all four Table-20 artifacts emitted per game (shared game_uid, game_id-derived names; config archived to config/games/ per rules 3-4)
- [x] infra/email_sender: Gmail REST over httpx, send-only scope, gatekeeper 'email' service, 429 backoff; REAL send verified (4 artifacts attached); scripts/gmail_auth.py mints send-only tokens
- [x] gui/live_view: belief heatmap + YOUR TURN/LOCKED/GAME OVER banner, snapshots via Perception (LOCAL TRUTH ONLY, rules 8-9); live screenshot captured from a real cross-repo game (assets/live_belief_map.png)
- [x] verify-log CLI: headless replay verification engine on saved logs (real-log Verified OK; tampered-log TAMPERED proven)
- [x] gui/replay viewer: verdict banner (Verified OK/TAMPERED), step-through board, hints shown; DPI-aware --screenshot; submission PNG captured (assets/replay_verified_ok.png)
- [x] Screenshots: both mandatory images captured (live belief map + replay Verified OK); per-state shots (YOUR TURN, LOCKED, TAMPERED demo) captured with docs/UI.md (assets/live_your_turn.png, assets/live_locked.png, assets/replay_tampered_demo.png; reproducible via scripts/capture_ui_states.py)

## Phase 8 — Submission
- [x] README: user manual + academic report complete (all six mandatory components + ISO 25010 + course anchors; screenshots embedded)
- [x] docs/UI.md
- [x] docs/LEAGUE_RUNBOOK.md + docs/DEPLOYMENT.md (tunnel URLs per agent, token-expiry gotcha, per-game commit-ID email duty)
- [x] RL experiment: evasion Q-learning (from-scratch fails hard exploration; informed prior -> 1.00 with amplified weights) + curves
- [x] scripts/check_submission.py PASS; [ ] v1.0-submission tag AFTER league games
- [ ] Moodle: form PDF (unaltered fields), per-member submission, team code anrbj666

## Phase 8 status (2026-07-13)
- [x] Series support: --sub-game override + series-result aggregator (per-group totals, sub-games won, tie at tie_score); 2-sub-game local series proven end-to-end
- [x] notebooks/analysis.ipynb + docs/COST.md (see Phase 8 status)
- [ ] v1.0-submission annotated tags (AFTER the real league games)
- [x] REAL league games: FIVE counted vs five different teams, all filed - four won, one drawn (imreeyal, vibecode, uoh-sqak, best2934, najamjad 3-3) - rule-52 minimum more than doubled; 422-202 on points, 26-4 on sub-games

## Final tri-audit fixes (2026-07-13, full PDF re-validation)
- [x] BLOCKER: technical loss now still emits artifacts + email (rules 32/35)
- [x] BLOCKER: TAMPERED/failed audit voids the game -> technical_loss score (rule 19)
- [x] MAJOR: opponent nonces persisted into the log; verify-log + replay verify BOTH halves (rules 20/36)
- [x] MAJOR: counted_games_played from config (rules 37-38) - update per counted game
- [x] Gatekeeper queue-not-reject + concurrency semaphore (guidelines 5.1/5.3); ADR-0003 scopes the peer channel out
- [x] PLAN module map synced to the shipped tree (re-synced 2026-07-21: sdk/domain/peer/strategy/shared/report rows now cover every shipped module)
- [ ] League day: share private repos with lecturer (rmisegal) OR make public; flip [email] mode=send; update counted_games_played each game

## Hardening & measured strategy (2026-07-21)
- [x] Chaos-drill suite (D1-D4 + LIVE tunnel kill/heal) with committed JSONL evidence; HTTP 530 retry fix proven over the real public edge (docs/evidence/chaos-drills.md)
- [x] Config-range fuzzer: 40/40 sampled Appendix-VI-legal configs pass every invariant (docs/evidence/config-fuzz.md)
- [x] Crash-resume: per-half-turn snapshots + --resume path; kill-and-resume drill recovers in 44 ms, mutual audits Verified OK (docs/evidence/crash-resume.md)
- [x] Self-mirror deception policy: lies 17.8 -> 3.0 per game vs the honesty coin at the same 1.00 survival — ON (docs/evidence/deception.md)
- [x] Deception by movement (StealthThiefBrain): survival 0.00 -> 1.00 vs the strongest in-repo cop — ON, league default via the CertifiedThiefBrain wrapper (docs/evidence/movement-deception.md)
- [x] Keep-gated survival certificate: honest negative result (0 certificates fired in 180 games) — ships OFF inside the default wrapper (docs/evidence/thief-certificate.md)
- [x] Third-party pair verifier (one game, two logs, one verdict) + committed-artifact guard over every committed log pair (report/pair_verify.py)
- [x] Buffer-ahead sealing fix: a split commit+reveal pair no longer reads as desync (peer/sealing.py)

## League-grade hidden wire & cross-team rehearsal (2026-07-22..25)
- [x] Reference-v3 hidden client behind the negotiated wire_shape lock (src wire/ + sdk/hidden.py; ADR-0007 addendum + ADR-0008; mechanism PRD: docs/PRD_09_hidden_wire.md)
- [x] Registered flat-terms handshake + role/sub-game pairing declarations + dedup-safe agreement re-push + typed bystander tolerance (PairingRefusalError)
- [x] Claim-mediated capture + foreign-fair audit tiers (alignment by commit; Board-physics reconstruction; digest not-comparable, never false)
- [x] Reference-conformant series result + rule-35 settlement guard; league-day runner with email preflight, auto-close and the doubly-armed lecturer-address interlock
- [x] REAL cross-team play: warm-up games audits Verified OK on both sides + full 6-sub-game counted-format rehearsal (47-47 structural tie); mutually discarded evidence relocated to docs/evidence/discarded-series/ (outside the aggregation path, still committed history)
- [x] Documentation-fidelity pass (2026-07-25): README Part II (dual wire, cross-team verification subsection, hidden replay witness assets/replay_hidden_verified.png, counts 617 tests / 93.12%), PRD_09, matrix PRD_01..09, this ledger

## Evasion counter-build: reach-decoded belief + anti-freeze doctrine (2026-07-26)
- [x] domain/evidence.py (parity-locked, paired commit): trail readings decode to REACH balls (kernel-rung hypotheses, ring rungs fresh-only); observe_scent spreads evidence over the ball — the posterior follows a mover instead of locking onto a camp's afterglow (tests/unit/test_domain/test_evidence.py)
- [x] observe_barrier + both-wire Perception wiring: a declared placement pins the placer's passable origin cells (law of barriers), redelivery-safe on the reference wire
- [x] observe_region + gazetteer parsing tier (config/gazetteer.json, private): place-name talk lands as region observations under profiler weights + scent lie check; inbound-only, rule 27 untouched
- [x] DoctrineThiefBrain ([strategy.doctrine], wired into the shipped CertifiedThiefBrain chain): fresh-flee (live trail NEAR US widens the flee cap, bounded), stay-cap (consecutive STAYs capped while the mirror glows), pocket-escape (config-gated cross-quadrant flight), top-k wall forecast (MIN over the belief support) — two reconstructed kill-juncture regression tests pin the capability
- [x] AgedBeliefTrapCop measurement instrument + scripts/measure_thief_counter.py keep-gate A/B (60 games/cop/arm, shared seeds, leave-one-out ablations vs both wall-capable hunters)
- [x] Keep-gates applied to defaults: fresh_flee ON (+0.50/+0.167), stay_cap ON (+0.35 vs trap), forecast ON (+0.10 vs trap), pocket_escape OFF (survival-neutral both hunters — honest negative, capability stays tested)
- [x] Gates: 657 tests green, branch coverage 93.26%, ruff 0, caps OK, physics parity green both directions

## DoD-observed ledger (measured evidence per completed phase)

Every "done" above is backed by a regenerable artifact; the deep narratives
live in `docs/evidence/`:

| Claim | Measured | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Public P2P games work end-to-end | 35-turn sealed games over the tunnel, identical digests, audits Verified OK both directions | `docs/evidence/public-games.md`, `results/dev-history/results/public_bidirectional_e2e_*.json` |
| Reference interop is proven, not assumed | 13/13 conformance tests over the league kit's vectors; counterparty package re-verified 35/35 | `docs/evidence/interop-alignment.md`, `tests/unit/test_reference_conformance.py` |
| Disqualification rules are enforced | 5 rule-guard invariants in CI + tamper drills read TAMPERED | `docs/evidence/rule-guards.md`, `tests/unit/test_rule_guards.py` |
| Strategy claims are measured | full RL campaign incl. four gated promotions (all held) and the wire-shape balance tables | `docs/evidence/rl-campaign.md`, `results/experiments/*.json` |
| Faults are survived, not hoped away (2026-07-21) | chaos drills D1-D4 + LIVE tunnel kill/heal all PASS: dedup, bounded waits, clean technical-loss classification, healed public game | `docs/evidence/chaos-drills.md`, `docs/evidence/drills/*.jsonl` |
| Any legal config plays clean (2026-07-21) | fuzzer: 40/40 sampled legal configs complete with matching digests + Verified OK audits | `docs/evidence/config-fuzz.md`, `results/experiments/config_fuzz.json` |
| A killed game recovers (2026-07-21) | resume drill: snapshot restored in 44 ms, 6 half-turns replayed, mutual audits Verified OK | `docs/evidence/crash-resume.md`, `docs/evidence/drills/resume_recovery_2026-07-21.jsonl` |
| Lying is a policy, not a coin (2026-07-21) | 3.0 lies/game vs the coin's 17.8 at the same 1.00 survival | `docs/evidence/deception.md`, `results/experiments/deception_policy.json` |
| Movement itself deceives (2026-07-21) | stealth walking flips survival 0.00 -> 1.00 vs the strongest in-repo cop — ON | `docs/evidence/movement-deception.md`, `results/experiments/movement_deception.json` |
| Negative results ship honestly (2026-07-21) | survival certificate: 0 fires in 180 games — OFF by keep-gate inside the default wrapper | `docs/evidence/thief-certificate.md`, `results/experiments/thief_certificate.json` |
| The hidden wire is league-grade end-to-end (2026-07-22) | reference-v3 phase 2: sdk wire-shape routing, hidden artifacts verify (verify-log + pair verifier, both directions), hidden kill-and-resume drill restored in 0.066 s, LIVE cross-repo g03 game: 35-turn survival, identical digests, pair-verify Verified OK | `docs/adr/0008-hidden-audit-reconstruction.md`, `docs/evidence/drills/hidden_resume_recovery_2026-07-22.jsonl`, `results/dev-history/results/log_anrbj666-vs-anrbj666_g03.json` |
| The counted format is rehearsed against a real rival (2026-07-24) | warm-up games: full 35 turns, audits Verified OK on BOTH sides, digest_match honestly null across per-team constructions; then all six sub-games of the counted format, roles alternating, every audit Verified OK, the predicted 47-47 structural tie + the ONE series email; the discarded series is committed history OUTSIDE the aggregation path | `docs/evidence/discarded-series/`, `config/games/config_anrbj666-vs-imreeyal_g*.json` |
| One game, two logs, one third-party verdict (re-run 2026-07-25) | `verify_pair` on the committed twin logs: g01 (bookletter) and g03 (hidden) both `overall: Verified OK`; per-side `verify-log` on the rival-game logs: Verified OK in both repos; the hidden replay witness PNG regenerated from the committed CLI | `scripts/verify_pair.py`, `results/dev-history/results/log_anrbj666-vs-anrbj666_g0*.json`, `assets/replay_hidden_verified.png` |
| The belief tracks movers, not memories (2026-07-26) | reach-decoded evidence: posterior peak 3 cells behind an 8-step escapee and clear of the abandoned camp (raw-intensity weighting: 6 behind, camp-anchored); a declared wall localizes its placer (>0.6 origin mass); landmark talk parses to regions | `tests/unit/test_domain/test_evidence.py`, `tests/unit/test_peer/test_barrier_perception.py`, `src/p2p_thief/domain/evidence.py` |
| Camping died, measured (2026-07-26) | 60-game shared-seed arms: doctrine thief 1.00 vs the aged-belief hunter (old 0.80), 1.00 vs blind pursuit (0.883), 0.45 vs the full-info wall cop (0.00), no regressions; per-knob keep-gates applied — fresh_flee +0.50/+0.167, stay_cap +0.35, forecast +0.10, pocket_escape survival-neutral and defaulted OFF (honest negative); two reconstructed kill junctures pinned as regression tests | `docs/evidence/thief-counter.md`, `results/experiments/thief_counter.json`, `tests/unit/test_strategy/test_doctrine.py` |

## Dwell-plateau localization and the re-opened certificate (2026-07-26)
- [x] domain/evidence.py `plateau_origin` + `BeliefMap.observe_plateau` (parity-locked, paired commit): a dweller saturates 21 of the 25 kernel offsets (fixed point delta/rho vs the clamp) and stamps its own window, so fitting that SHAPE back inverts to its cell where per-cell reach-decoding ties flat. Localization 7% -> 89% exact, 2.42 -> 0.11 cells (mechanism PRD: docs/PRD_10_plateau_localization.md)
- [x] Abstention gates (min cells / min fit / margin) + golden vectors covering the three REFUSALS as well as the pin -- parity hashing catches twin drift, vectors catch a change made identically in both
- [x] `lethal_gate`: a landing any believed hunter can END next turn ranks below every landing none can; closes the herded-corner walk-in (survival 0.900 -> 1.000, 150 games; permanent regression in test_doctrine_junctures.py)
- [x] Keep-gates RE-MEASURED on the shipped Perception pipeline (the arena harnesses had been bypassing it): survival certificate re-opened (0 -> 120 fires) and enabled for PROOF over coincidence, survival unchanged and said so; doctrine gates re-confirmed (fresh_flee +0.475/+0.225, forecast +0.075); stay_cap kept ON on the mirror argument despite a neutral measurement
- [x] Live E2E on the reference wire, both sub-games: both sides Verified OK with matching end-state digests
- [x] Team #2 outreach for the second counted series (passing condition) - second team FOUND; counted series scheduled for the weekend of 2026-08-08

## Information regimes and the deferred `derived` mode (2026-07-27)
- [x] `shared/info_modes.py`: regimes are a registry with declared wire-shape legality, resolved once at construction; unknown or unserviceable regimes are startup errors instead of silent downgrades (ADR-0006 addendum). `brain_view` is the single extension point.
- [x] `[deception]` defaults moved beside the other tunable tables in `shared/tuning.py`; role-specific values unchanged (verified: cop 2/6/0.4, thief 3/4/0.35 plus the movement sub-table).
- [ ] **DEFERRED - `info_mode = "derived"`** (invert the transmitted scent field to the sender's exact cell, ADR-0010). Designed, measured, not built: belief mode already measures at ceiling under league conditions (cop 1.000 vs the live opponent, 0.983 across the evader pool; thief 1.000 vs every blind hunter), so it buys nothing we need and it would contradict the Dec-POMDP framing the report is built on.
  - **Trigger to revisit:** an opponent proposes the bookletter wire with `info_mode = "exact"`. That legitimately hands them our true position every turn and puts our thief back against a full-information wall-builder (arena: 0.611 overall, 0.00 vs the deep-RL trap cop). Response options: decline `exact` (our default is reference + belief, so declining is the status quo), or counter-propose `derived` under a both-declare acceptance so the information is symmetric.
  - Shipping it would require: a registry row, a `brain_view` branch, a both-declare acceptance field in the handshake, and disclosure to the peer - never a silent flip.

## Cross-team convergence campaign vs imreeyal + grader-instruction rounds (2026-08-03)
- [x] Report cadence settled against book s9.3.3 + the reference: per-sub-game email REMOVED; the ONE series email is the mandated report (ADR-0009 addendum)
- [x] Step-0 commit-id declaration on TWO channels: negotiate identity + the SEALED step_zero record (book-attached shape); the rival's copy is read back and a cross-channel mismatch is a recorded finding (rule 53 / p. 40 box)
- [x] Book-attached example set adopted (docs/googleBotMissingFiles): role-aware commit columns per window, the three league fields keyed on the COUNTED arming (a friendly fabricates no counted record), mutual_agreement trimmed, flat config artifact, declaration in symmetric group_1/group_2 shape (ADR-0012)
- [x] Moodle item-4 resolved: superset (14 attachments) first, then REVERTED to result-only on the course chatbot's ruling; four templates reach the lecturer via email (result) + GitHub (rest) (ADR-0012 second addendum)
- [x] mutual_agreement.sha256 = the reference symmetric-outcome scope, adopted JOINTLY: byte-identical across both teams' independently emitted files, proven live (ADR-0012 third addendum)
- [x] Four validation windows in one day (16:00 / 17:45 / 19:35 / 20:15): 24 sub-games, every audit Verified OK on both sides; final pair diff ZERO findings
- [x] Clean-tree procedure: pre-archive artifacts before T so declarations seal clean commit hashes (runbook clean-commit note)
- [x] Truthful hardware declaration (registry VRAM, real CPU freq/GPU) + llm_model names the provider; inbound hint VIEW capped at the signed word limit (audit comparisons untouched)
- [x] Counted game.json draft ready and rival-reviewed (docs/drafts/game.counted.json - agreed_between anrbj666/imreeyal; adopt byte-identically at T)
- [x] Rival-repo rulebook audit run (their request-symmetric): disqualification tier clean; findings shared (stale M0 README, fifth-artifact citation, dual game-id residue)
- [x] COUNTED series vs imreeyal: played and filed 2026-08-04 — 90-30, 6-0
- [x] COUNTED series vs team #2 (vibecode): played and filed 2026-08-08 — 75-35, 5-1
- [x] COUNTED series vs uoh-sqak: played and filed 2026-08-17 — 90-30, 6-0, diversity reward
- [x] COUNTED series vs best2934: played and filed 2026-08-20 — 90-30, 6-0, diversity reward; digests matched digit-for-digit, filings cross-forwarded
- [x] League campaign COMPLETE: 5 counted, 4 wins + 1 draw (422-202), rule-52 minimum more than doubled; kit conformance + pairing verification process documented in docs/OPPONENT_ONBOARDING.md (kit: https://github.com/Imreec/copthief-league-protocol)
