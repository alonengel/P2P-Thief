"""Two-runtime cross-cadence proof (live-interop regression): police and
thief runtimes as REAL counterparts. The thief opens (demo runtime seeds
the thief's turn before its receive-respond loop), each side numbers its
OWN steps 1, 2, 3... (demo own_state.apply_move), the mutual audit verifies
with a consistent reconstruction, and the live-GUI perception feed fires on
BOTH sides with local truth only — the live-session thief window stayed
black precisely because that callback never fired."""
