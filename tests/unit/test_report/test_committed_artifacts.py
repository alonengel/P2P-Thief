"""Every log artifact COMMITTED to the repo must replay-verify clean.

A stale sealed log (e.g. one generated before a byte-form migration and
never regenerated) reads TAMPERED to any grader or rival running the
replay verifier - this guard makes that class of drift impossible to miss.
Swept homes: results/ top level (the counted series once played - it
starts EMPTY so counted artifacts arrive as pure adds), the per-window
friendly snapshots, and the dev-history archive; the latter two are laid
out as mini repo roots so each log's config artifact resolves beside it."""
