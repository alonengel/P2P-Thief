"""Tolerant identity reader: nested `opponent_info.identity` wins, a FLAT
opponent_info is the fallback.

League 2026-08-15 (best2934): a peer sent its identity fields flat on
opponent_info â€” no nested `identity` block â€” declaring
counted_games_played: 1 and its commit on every handshake, and our reader
looked one level too deep, recording 0 and "unknown" while the truth sat
in our own wire record. Split from test_series_doc.py for the 150-line cap.
