"""The emitted game_uid must be the one the WIRE agreed, not a local one.

Rule 35 makes the two teams' reports the enforcement mechanism: they are
reconciled by game_uid, so a uid only we can compute makes our report
unjoinable to the sealed evidence and reads as contradictory.

The reference derives it from the flat NEGOTIATED terms
(peer/handshake.py: `derive_game_ids(terms_from_config(config), ...)`), not
from the raw config file. We mirrored the construction but fed it the whole
game.json, which is deterministic too - and permanently different.
