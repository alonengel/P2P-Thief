"""Credibility of an ASSERTED trail (reference wire, rules 8-9 boundary).

`smell_grid` rides beside `commit`, never inside it, so no end-of-game hash
audit can check it: a hostile peer may transmit any field at all. Physics is
the only check left - a reading must be explainable by ONE emitter moving a
step per turn. Soundness comes first here: a false refusal is a self-inflicted
denial of service, so the anchor is the AGREED start, never a later estimate.
