"""Floored-residue tolerance: a peer that zeroes sub-epsilon residues at
serialization breaks the update law by NOISE, not by motion (najamjad
2026-08-22: smallest value they ever transmit is 0.005341; four refused
frames were single remote cells crossing their ~0.005 floor, prev 0.0054
-> lawful 0.00486 -> transmitted 0). Refusing such frames is correct
evidence but a latch hazard: cells laid on adjacent turns cross the
floor on adjacent turns, and three consecutive breaks latch scent off
for the whole game — a self-inflicted blinding against an honest-but-
sloppy emitter. The tolerance re-solves the transition with the floored
cells restored to their lawful decay; acceptance is recorded separately
(floored evidence, not refusal) so rule-36 reporting keeps the trail.
