"""Perception's trust boundary: where an asserted trail becomes belief.

The movement-model check lives here because this is the only place a
transmitted field turns into a posterior. Both properties are load-bearing:
it must NEVER refuse an honest trail (the refusal latches, so a false positive
blinds the peer for the whole game), and it must refuse an impossible one
permanently rather than per-turn.
