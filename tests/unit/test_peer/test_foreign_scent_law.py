"""A rival on the league's OTHER scent branch must not blind us.

The league forked: we run the book's `multiplicative_book_v1`, the course
reference and several teams run `subtractive_chebyshev_v1` (SMNGRP05
2026-08-24, ali-ahm1 2026-08-23). Under subtraction a cell legally falls
below (1-rho) times its previous value, so our law solver finds NO emitter
in ANY honest frame: three frames latch `scent_trusted` off and we play the
rest of the sub-game blind against an honest peer. Their own tracker calls
this out — "one disagreement is far likelier to be a dialect than a
forgery" — and tolerates it.

`rival_scent_law = "foreign"` consumes the field as belief evidence and
verifies no decay law. What it does NOT relax is geometry: the saturation
envelope still latches on a deposit nowhere reachable, so a forgery is
still refused.
