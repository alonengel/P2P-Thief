"""Rules 46/47 adjudicated from a FOREIGN rival's own revealed positions.

Live finding 2026-08-01: our cop sealed their thief into the SE corner in
three games (barriers (5,6) then (6,5), thief at (6,6)); their peer never ran
its own imprisonment check, played 23 more steps and claimed survival. A
barrier capture is self-declared under hidden information, so the REVEAL is
the only place we can prove it — and the foreign-schema tier was not looking.
