"""An honest game must not self-destruct at the audit (imreeyal repo review
2026-08-03, finding #1): a cop can LAND on the thief's true cell while its
belief says otherwise — below the claim threshold nothing is declared, the
thief cannot see the co-location (hidden wire), and the game legitimately
plays on. The strict reconstruction must record that as disputed evidence
(like the foreign tier) and follow the LIVE game's claim-mediated outcome —
never raise tampering. Law captures (barrier/surrounded) stay strict: the
thief self-detects those and playing past them is genuine evidence."""
