"""The capture-claim gate: claim our TRUE cell, but not every turn.

The claim names our real position, so an unconditional claim broadcasts the
cop's exact cell on every move — and a claim-reading thief collapses its
estimate onto it (2026-08-01: the rival's thief does exactly that, and their
own published sweep prices a quiet cop at ~24% of cop points). Gating changes
what we SAY, never whether what we say is true.
