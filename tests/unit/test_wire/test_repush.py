"""push_agreement: BOTH deliveries make a handshake (najamjad w5,
2026-08-23). Live-observed deadlock mirrored here: our one offer landed
5.5s before the rival's window boundary and was answered with an
explicit retriable busy refusal ({"accepted": false}); their offer then
arrived and the old loop adopted it and STOPPED pushing - so the rival
never held ours, refused to open turn 1, and re-offered eleven times
into a queue nobody read while we waited 611s for a turn that could
never come. The loop must keep pushing until OUR send is acknowledged
accepted; an ack WITHOUT the accepted key (unknown reference shapes)
counts as delivered, so conformant-peer behavior is unchanged. Late
re-offers arriving after negotiate mean the rival still lacks ours:
answer_reoffers re-sends from the wait loop.
