"""Judging a FOREIGN-schema rival's audit half fairly (2026-07-24 finding).

The record shapes here reproduce the foreign-schema rival's REAL reveal
form from the first full cross-team games: reference sealing — per-step
payloads keyed step/state/position/move/intent/verdict/hint/
prompt_discussion/model/tokens/... (no role, no action) plus the step-0
system_spec record whose commit never crosses the live turn wire. Only the
COMMIT construction (SHA256(canonical(payload)+'|'+nonce)) is the shared
contract; the payload schema is per-team. The audit must verify such a half
clean, degrade to derivable checks, and report the digest tier as
not-comparable — while a genuinely forged commit still reads TAMPERED."""
