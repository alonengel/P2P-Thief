"""Outbound extra headers, config-declared per pairing.

League 2026-08-16 (best2934): their network began blocking cloudflared's
port outright, their door moved behind ngrok's free tier, and that tier
answers any request WITHOUT `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` with an HTML
interstitial carrying HTTP 200 — a naive readiness check passes and the
JSON parse then dies mid-handshake. The transport must therefore build its
client with the config-declared headers when any are given, and exactly as
before when none are.
