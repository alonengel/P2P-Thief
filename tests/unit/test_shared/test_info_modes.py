"""Information-regime registry: legality is checked, never assumed.

The failure this guards is specific: a peer that believes it agreed to one
regime and plays another. A typo used to degrade silently to belief on the
reference wire, and an `exact` request on a wire with no rival positions was
ignored rather than refused. Both are now startup errors.
