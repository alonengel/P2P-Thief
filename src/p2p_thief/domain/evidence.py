"""Trail-evidence decode (rulebook ch. 4, Appendix VI) — parity-locked.

A reading of a transmitted scent field is a CLOCK, not a beacon: under the
fixed book model every value is some kernel deposit K_d (placed at Manhattan
ring d of the emitter) decayed ×(1-rho)=0.9 per full turn. A value therefore
decodes to a REACH radius d + age — the Manhattan ball the emitter must
occupy NOW — and its evidence weight spreads over that ball, so an aged
plateau thins out while fresh evidence stays sharp.
