"""Trail-evidence decode (rulebook ch. 4, Appendix VI) — parity-locked.

A reading of a transmitted scent field is a CLOCK, not a beacon: under the
fixed book model every value is some kernel deposit K_d (placed at Manhattan
ring d of the emitter) decayed ×(1-rho)=0.9 per full turn. A value therefore
decodes to a REACH radius d + age — the Manhattan ball the emitter must
occupy NOW — and its evidence weight spreads over that ball, so an aged
plateau thins out while fresh evidence stays sharp.

Second decode (plateau_origin): under re-emission the update rule drives a
kernel cell toward delta/rho, so every offset with delta >= rho*center
SATURATES at the clamp while the far corners never do. A dweller therefore
stamps its own kernel window onto the board at max intensity — and fitting
that SHAPE back inverts to the emitter's own cell, board clipping included.
Reach-decoding alone cannot: every saturated cell reads reach 0, so the
evidence ties flat across the whole plateau. Camping is self-reporting.
