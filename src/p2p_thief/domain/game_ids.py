"""Game identifiers and the Table-20 artifact filenames (parity-locked).

Filenames derive from game_id + sub-game number so files from different
games can never mix (Appendix VI Table 20 remark). The game_uid follows the
official reference construction (ADR-0004): a pure function of the agreed
terms + the two group ids, so BOTH peers compute the identical uid with no
extra round-trip and all eight artifacts (four per team) share it.
