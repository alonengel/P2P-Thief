"""Pheromone (scent) physics — rulebook ch. 4, Appendix VI (all params FIXED).

Update rule, applied exactly ONCE per FULL turn (after both agents acted):
    tau'(c) = clamp((1 - rho) * tau(c) + delta(c), 0, center_intensity)
where delta comes from the 5x5 radial kernel centered on the emitting agent
(the book's reference matrix, Figure 4), clipped at board borders. A cell the
kernel never reached reads 0.0 — silence is missing info, not negative info.

The upper clamp encodes the book's stated range tau in [0, 0.9] under
re-emission (PRD 01 documented assumption). This whole module is part of the
scent model that gets SHA-256-locked with the opponent before a series
(rule 23) and is parity-locked with the twin repo.
