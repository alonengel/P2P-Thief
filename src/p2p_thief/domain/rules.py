"""Win conditions and the law of barriers (rulebook ch. 3, rules 46-48).

All three capture families resolve AUTOMATICALLY in the replicated engines
(barrier-on-thief, fully-blocked thief, cop landing on the thief): every
half-turn is commit-revealed, so the thief's position is cryptographically
committed and a separate Capture-Claim/response exchange would add nothing
the audit does not already prove - the book's claim-time truth duty is
subsumed by the sealed records (ADR-0005).

Parity-locked with the twin repo.
