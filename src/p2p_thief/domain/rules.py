"""Win conditions and the law of barriers (rulebook ch. 3, rules 46-48).

Two capture families with different downstream obligations (PRD 01):
- AUTOMATIC captures (no claim, no truth-duty): a barrier placed on the
  thief's cell, or a thief left with all four neighbors impassable.
- LANDING capture: cop occupies the thief's cell — at the protocol layer this
  one carries a cryptographic Capture Claim (Phase 6).

Parity-locked with the twin repo.
