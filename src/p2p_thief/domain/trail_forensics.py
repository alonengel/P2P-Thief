"""Is a TRANSMITTED trail one an agent could actually have produced?

Split from evidence.py, which decodes what a reading MEANS; this module asks
the prior question of whether to believe it at all. It exists because the
guarantee the rulebook leans on is a property of the WIRE SHAPE: under the
replicated-engine wire the trail is derived from applied moves and cannot lie,
but under the reference wire it is transmitted beside `commit` and never
inside it, so no hash audit can reach it (ADR-0010).

Two checks, weakest first. `incredible_saturation` bounds WHERE a deposit may
appear given the movement model - all that a single frame can support.
`transition_emitters` uses the far tighter constraint between CONSECUTIVE
frames: the update law is arithmetic, so a deposit is non-negative and no cell
may fall below `(1-rho)` times its own previous value. A forgery can respect
the movement model, but it cannot move its own HISTORY.
