"""Perception: one peer's LOCAL truth (rules 8-9) - belief, hints, snapshots.

Everything the live GUI may show flows through here: my cell, my belief map,
public barriers, the received hint. The rival's true position never does.

Trust boundary. Under the replicated-engine wire the rival's trail is a
CONSEQUENCE of applied moves, so it is unforgeable in the book's sense. Under
the reference wire it is TRANSMITTED - `smell_grid` rides beside `commit`,
never inside it, so no end-of-game hash audit can ever check it. This module
is where an asserted trail becomes belief, so this is where it is held to the
movement model: a reading claiming a clamp-level deposit somewhere no emitter
moving a step per turn could have reached is refused WHOLE for that turn
(the diffused prior stands) rather than partly believed.
