"""Floored-residue tolerance for the scent law gate (najamjad 2026-08-22).

Some emitters zero sub-epsilon residues at serialization (najamjad's
floor sits at ~0.005: smallest value ever transmitted 0.005341, and all
four refused frames of the 17:50 six were single remote cells crossing
it). The update law forbids any cell falling below (1-rho) times its
previous value, so such frames are honest motion wearing a serialization
bug — refusing them is correct evidence, but a LATCH HAZARD: trail cells
laid on adjacent turns cross the floor on adjacent turns, and three
consecutive breaks latch scent trust off for the whole game. Blinding
ourselves against an honest-but-sloppy emitter loses games to noise.

The tolerance: when the raw transition admits no emitter, re-solve with
every floored cell (previous > 0, current == 0, lawful next value at or
under epsilon) restored to its lawful decay. Solvable after restoration
means the frame tracks — accepted, with the floored cells returned as
EVIDENCE (surfaced beside refusals, never silently). A zeroed cell whose
lawful value exceeds epsilon is real physics violation and still refuses:
at 0.005 intensity a forger hides ten-turn-old history, nothing else, so
the tolerance launders noise and only noise.
