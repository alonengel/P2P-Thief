"""Judging a FOREIGN-schema rival's revealed half fairly (league SPEC).

The shared interop contract is exactly two things: the canonical JSON and
the commit construction SHA256(canonical(payload) + "|" + nonce). The
PAYLOAD schema and the end-digest construction are PER-TEAM choices, NOT
interop constraints — so the audit must never call an honest rival a cheat
for sealing different keys than ours.

Live finding (2026-07-24, first full cross-team games): a reference-shaped
rival played 35 clean turns and our audit still rendered TAMPERED, because
(1) its reveal set carries a step-0 system-spec record whose commit never
crossed the live turn wire, so a strict zip+length check can never align;
(2) our commit recompute refused payloads missing OUR pinned field set; and
(3) the physics reconstruction assumed our role/action keys. The tiers here
fix all three: the commit check is schema-agnostic, alignment is BY COMMIT,
and a commit-clean but unparseable half is judged only on what is derivable
(per-sender step continuity, revealed-position movement legality) — never
labeled TAMPERED for its schema. Digest comparison across two different
per-team constructions is meaningless: it reports not-comparable (None).
