"""Reference-v3 flat-terms negotiate handshake (league kit CORE vector).

The registered reference-v3 wire shape uses the REFERENCE's literal
negotiate form: a flat 14-key `terms` dict + `nonce` + `signature =
SHA256(canonical(terms) + "|" + nonce)` — pinned byte-for-byte by the kit's
terms_signature vector. The bookletter agreement's config_sha256
substitution is a bookletter-v3 property and must NOT appear here. Terms
are DERIVED from the signed game.json (never duplicated); the locked-model
declarations (scent_model_sha256, wire_shape_sha256 via wire/lock.py,
info_mode) ride alongside OUTSIDE the signature under the registry's
refusal rule: refuse only when BOTH peers declare a family and the values
differ — omission is never refusal (the unmodified reference peer declares
nothing at all).
