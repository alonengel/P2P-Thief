"""Wire-shape lock + negotiation seam (both-declare, like info_mode).

The signed terms are a frozen key set, so the wire-shape choice is declared
as the SHA-256 of a published lock doc (config/wire_shape_lock.json — the
interop registry's `reference-v3` entry, one shared {family, name, params,
example} envelope) under `wire_shape_sha256` in the negotiate extras — the
same pattern as scent_model_sha256. Refusal fires ONLY when both peers
declare and the hashes differ; omission is never refusal. The bookletter
runtime stays the untouched default: an undeclared game is byte-identical
to before this module existed.
