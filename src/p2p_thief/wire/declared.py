"""Live public declarations vs the sealed reveals (rules 15-16, 21-22) —
split from wire/audit.py for the 150-code-line cap.

What a peer DECLARED live beside its commit (barrier cell, hint, capture
claim) must match what its reveal proves it sealed; a mismatch is tampering
evidence. Records carrying no declared block (commit-only halves, geometric
records, pre-upgrade logs) derive nothing and are never refused.
