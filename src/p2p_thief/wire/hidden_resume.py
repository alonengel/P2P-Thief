"""Hidden-wire crash-resume (E6 pattern under reference-v3 secrecy rules).

The geometric snapshot replays BOTH sides' actions into a fresh engine; the
hidden wire cannot — the rival's moves are sealed commits until audit. So
the snapshot persists exactly what this peer truly holds: the OwnState facts
(my cell, the public barrier record, the boundary-cell history that replays
my scent field deterministically, the clock and turn token, the rival's last
transmitted scent snapshot) plus the HiddenExchange records (own nonces
never crossed the wire pre-audit, so they may live in a LOCAL file) and the
verified opponent agreement. The resume_offer control handshake re-sends
only the last sealed TurnMessage — it carries the COMMIT alone, so a
crash+resume can never become a pre-audit reveal (rule 18 survives E6).
