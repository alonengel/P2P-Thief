"""Capture-claim flow — the truth duty is STRUCTURAL (rules 21-22).

The thief's answer to a capture claim is a pure function of its OWN state
and the claimed cell. No strategy object, brain, config flag or RNG appears
in any signature here, so no strategy code can alter the answer: the
truthful path is the only path. The automatic capture families
(barrier-on-thief, fully-blocked thief) stay automatic per the book — the
concession here only SAYS what the physics already decided.
