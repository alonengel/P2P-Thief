"""Own-state engine for the hidden-information wire (rules 8-9 structural).

Tracks ONLY what this peer truly knows: its own cell, the public barrier
record (own placements plus every absorbed barrier_placed declaration), its
own scent field under the locked multiplicative_book_v1 model, and the turn
clock. The rival's position is STRUCTURALLY absent — `positions` holds a
single key, so any code that asks for the rival's cell fails loudly instead
of silently peeking. Duck-types the engine surface that Perception, the
Deceiver and the brains read, which is exactly what makes belief-only play
enforceable by shape rather than by discipline.
