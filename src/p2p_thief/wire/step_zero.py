"""The sealed step-zero declaration record (book-attached example shape).

The book's attached 3-game-log opens each sub-game's records with a signed
step-zero carrying what changes per sub-game — most importantly the exact
github_commit the declaring side runs (p. 40 חובה box, rule 53). Sealed like
a move (nonce + commit) but it never crosses the live wire: the audit reveal
and the log carry it. The rival holds a SECOND copy of the same fact from our
negotiate identity — two channels that must agree, by construction (pairing
convention with imreeyal, 2026-08-03). HIDDEN WIRE ONLY: the bookletter
runtime stays byte-compatible with unmodified reference peers.
