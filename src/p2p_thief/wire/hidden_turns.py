"""Half-turn handlers + audit finish for the HiddenRuntime (split from
hidden_runtime.py for the 150-code-line cap; `rt` carries all the state).

Reference cadence (verified against the demo): the THIEF opens every round
— its runtime seeds turn 1 before the receive-respond loop — and each side
numbers its OWN steps 1, 2, 3... (demo own_state.apply_move). The thief's
step ticks the round clock: survival counts the thief's own steps (demo
rules.thief_result reads state.step_number), so the boundary — the
book-model update on this peer's OWN field, run BEFORE serializing — fires
on the thief's action on both peers.
