"""Half-turn handlers + audit finish for the HiddenRuntime (split from
hidden_runtime.py for the 150-code-line cap; `rt` carries all the state).

Cadence (PRD 01): the police opens every round; the thief's half-turn
closes it. Each peer runs the book-model update on its OWN field at the
boundary BEFORE serializing it, so every transmitted snapshot shows exactly
what the replicated engines would show at that moment.
