"""HiddenExchange: commit-only live wire, reveals deferred to the audit.

Subclasses the hardened SealedExchange RECEIVER (dedup of at-least-once
deliveries, out-of-order buffering, the flood cap, one deadline per expected
message) — reused, not forked. What changes is the protocol on top: per
half-turn only the COMMIT crosses the wire inside the TurnMessage; payloads
and nonces stay local until the end-of-game audit reveals them together
(rule 18 — and stronger: under this wire even the ACTION is secret live).
