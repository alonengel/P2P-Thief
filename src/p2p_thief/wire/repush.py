"""Agreement re-push for the hidden-wire negotiate (split from
hidden_runtime.py for the 150-code-line cap; `rt` carries the state).

Live-observed failure mirrored here: our greeting lands at the opponent's
PREVIOUS sub-game peer, which acks it into a dead queue and exits — the
agreement is swallowed, the faster side runs ahead and the series drifts
into a rule-35 shape. Re-sending the SAME payload (same nonce, so the
rival's receiver dedup makes repeats harmless) every few seconds gives the
greeting fresh chances at their real peer; the turn deadline still bounds
everything and the watchdog beats keep firing inside `rt._wait`.
