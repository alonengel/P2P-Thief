"""End-of-game audit for the hidden wire: reveal, verify, RECONSTRUCT.

Live messages carried only commits, so the audit boundary is where the game
becomes checkable: each side transmits its full sealed records (payloads +
nonces revealed TOGETHER, rule 18); the receiver re-hashes every reveal
against the commits received live (HiddenExchange.audit_reveals), then
replays BOTH sides' revealed actions through the domain physics (Board
legality, the barrier law, the boundary clock) and derives the end digest
in the protocol's canonical shape.

Deliberate deviation from the engine replay (documented): GameEngine calls
ANY co-location an instant capture, but under this wire a thief that walks
onto the cop's cell is unobservable live — capture is claim-mediated. The
replay therefore treats co-location as capture ONLY when the cop's own
action created it (landing or barrier), which is exactly what the wire can
prove; and it enforces the truth duty (rules 21-22): a cop action that
captures MUST be followed by the thief's action-free concession — a game
that played on past it is tampering evidence.
