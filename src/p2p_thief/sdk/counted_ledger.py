"""Rule-52 structural guard: at most ONE counted series per rival pairing
(split from sdk/series.py for the 150-code-line cap).

The ledger is COMMITTED evidence (`results/counted_series.json`): a false
game-count declaration is project-level disqualification (rule 38), so the
guard must survive a fresh clone, a different machine, and the SIBLING repo
having closed the series — reads consult every supplied results dir (both
role repos) plus the legacy gitignored `results/local/` copy; the write
lands in the committed path and the runbook commits it beside the game
artifacts. Rehearsal series (no league email) never enter it, which is
exactly the boundary the team wants: only games reported to the lecturer
count against the one-counted-game-per-rival rule. (Durability finding:
imreeyal repo review 2026-08-03, #4.)
