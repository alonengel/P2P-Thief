"""Rule-52 structural guard: at most ONE counted series per rival pairing
(split from sdk/series.py for the 150-code-line cap).

The ledger under results/local/ remembers every series whose report email
actually reached the league — results/local/ is gitignored and outside the
pre-series archive globs, so it survives both rehearsal churn and the
archive sweep. Rehearsal series (no league email) never enter it, which is
exactly the boundary the team wants: only games reported to the lecturer
count against the one-counted-game-per-rival rule.
