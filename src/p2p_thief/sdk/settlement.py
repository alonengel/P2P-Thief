"""Failure-path settlement (rules 32/35-36) — split from sdk/reporting.py
for the 150-code-line cap.

Two duties the happy path never exercises: when play() raised before the
normal finisher could run, the rival may still be alive and is owed our
audit disclosure (rules 35-36); and the artifact funnel must never let its
own exception eat a settled game's report (rule 32) — a failure lands ON
the report, which still reaches stdout. No email here: the one mandatory
report email is the SERIES result (book §9.3.3), sent at aggregation.
