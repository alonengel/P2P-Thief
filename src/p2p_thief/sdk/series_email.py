"""The ONE end-of-series report email (rule 32 + the grader's Moodle item 4;
ADR-0012 addendum) — split from sdk/series.py for the 150-code-line cap.

Fired only after a successful, settled emit. Attachments carry ALL FOUR
template types — declaration, per-window config and log, result — per the
grader's instruction ("the agent sends the lecturer the 4 signed templates
at game end"); the result stays the report and the body (book §9.3.3). A
partial evidence set is NAMED and refused, never sent.
