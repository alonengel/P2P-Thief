"""The ONE end-of-series report email (rule 32; split from sdk/series.py for
the 150-code-line cap).

Attachment policy — RESULT ONLY (ADR-0012, second addendum): the result file
is "הדוח המחייב הנשלח בדוא"ל" (book §9.3.3) and it REFERENCES the per-window
logs and configs (log_files, links) rather than embedding them; the course
chatbot confirms the reference implementation emails only the result. The
other three template types reach the lecturer via GitHub (§9.4, App ו §2
rules 4-5) — commit and push them per game. Moodle item 4 is read as the
delivery of all four templates across BOTH channels, per the bot's answer.
