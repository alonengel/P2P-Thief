"""Series aggregation guards (Appendix VI: num_games sub-games per series).

Sub-games alternate roles, so a team's full series record spans BOTH its
role repos - aggregation accepts several results directories. Three guards
protect the counterparty (rule 35: a report must never quietly invent or
complete a missing game): every sub-game 1..num_games needs a settled,
audit-clean log; logs from another series window (wrong game_uid or wrong
declared num_games - identical terms give identical game_uids across
instances, so BOTH must match) are excluded BY NAME, never silently; and
logs that cannot agree on one series game_uid are refused outright.
