"""The rival-facing identity declaration (split from config.py for the
150-code-line cap).

Mirrors the block the book's sample DECLARATION holds per team, so a peer can
fill OUR column of its own declaration from the handshake alone. Nobody can
source the opponent's identity locally, which is exactly how a report-diff
ends up with one column of nulls (2026-08-01, with imreeyal).
