"""Structural safety interlocks — never comment-based discipline.

Two guards that make rehearsal mistakes IMPOSSIBLE rather than discouraged:

* Lecturer-address interlock (rule 51 hygiene): email may address the
  league/lecturer ONLY when a counted game is doubly armed — `[email]
  counted = true` in config AND the `--counted` CLI flag on this very
  invocation. Rehearsals and friendlies structurally cannot reach the
  league inbox. The series report email (sdk/series.maybe_email_series —
  the ONE mandated email, book §9.3.3) routes through here.
* Sparring posture assertion: `peer --sparring` refuses at load time any
  warm-up file that carries tuned play ([strategy] overrides / weight
  tables) or an armed email path.
