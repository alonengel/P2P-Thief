"""Self-mirror deception: lie exactly when the lie pays (reputation economy).

A SECOND belief filter — fed ONLY by what WE transmit (our own scent trail,
our own hint claims; reusing the rival's exact BeliefMap math) — estimates
what the rival can currently infer about OUR cell. While exposure is low we
tell the truth: honest hints keep our credibility priced high in the rival's
profiler, which is precisely what makes the eventual lie land. Once exposure
crosses the configured threshold AND the rival is (by belief, never by its
true cell) closing in AND the budget/cooldown clock allows, we spend one lie
whose decoy claim points AWAY from the true heading. Intent flags stay
sealed until the audit (ch. 5), so lying remains legal and audit-honest.
All tunables live in game.toml [deception] (private, per-peer).
