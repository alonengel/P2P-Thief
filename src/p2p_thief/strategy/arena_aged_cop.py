"""Arena measurement cop: aged-belief tracking + low-threshold pounce +
gain-gated surgical walls (self-contained sparring instrument).

The hunting pattern our evasion work must survive: a cop that TRUSTS the
reach-decoded belief early — pouncing on weak peaks instead of waiting for
certainty, so a camper's beacon is punished before it can relocate — and
spends its wall quota only on placements that provably shrink the believed
room. Blind by construction: decide() consumes a BeliefMap; the true thief
cell is read only in the belief-less full-information fallback.
