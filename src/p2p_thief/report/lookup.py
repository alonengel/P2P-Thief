"""Resolve a log artifact's sibling CONFIG artifact and re-simulate physics.

Rule 20 requires the log to enable replay + verification for a third party.
Two helpers make that self-contained: `terms_for_log` finds the game's own
archived config (never assume defaults for negotiated terms), and
`recompute_digest` rebuilds a fresh engine from those terms, re-applies every
sealed action, and returns the recomputed end-state digest - turning
"records not tampered" into "records not tampered AND physics-legal".
