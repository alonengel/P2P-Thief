"""Clear a pairing's artifacts out of the aggregation path before a series.

Nothing in the protocol distinguishes a rehearsal from a counted series: the
same pair, the same signed terms and the same num_games derive the SAME
game_uid, by construction. So `sdk/series.collect_logs` cannot tell last
week's practice run from today's counted one - it votes on a consensus uid and
refuses on a tie, which means a previous run's logs left in `results/` either
deadlock the settlement or, far worse, get counted. A reported score assembled
partly from a game that never counted is the failure this module exists to
make impossible.

Archived, never deleted: the destination is `results/local/`, which is
gitignored (so repeated rehearsals create no churn) and which the aggregator's
NON-recursive glob cannot see. Evidence worth keeping is promoted to
`docs/evidence/` by hand, as a decision rather than a side effect.
