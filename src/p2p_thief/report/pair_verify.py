"""Third-party PAIR verification (league tooling, offline over saved files).

Given BOTH teams' log artifacts of the same game, verify each side alone
(the ch. 7 replay engine: commits + physics recompute) and then cross-check
that the two sealed views describe ONE game: same game_uid, same end-state
digest, same outcome, and every record one side sealed byte-equal to what
the other side received (commit equality is the cryptographic anchor).
Never touches a live game - input is files, output is a verdict dict.
